Description: Most of the cluster in the R packages
    functions provide plot functions for easy plotting of
    results. However, it is not always easy to extract the
    underlying data in order to manipulate these plots. The
    ggcluster packages addresses this problem by making
    available a series of methods to extract the plot
    segment as well as data labels available in data frame
    format. This data can then be manipulated or passed to
    ggplot() for plotting. The package supports data
    extraction for hclust, dendrogram, tree, kmeans and
    Mclust.
